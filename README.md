Demo repo for [today's class](http://training.github.com/classes/free/#July-29-2015) on fixing merge conflicts. Feel free to fork!

### Notes
- [Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/docs)
- The examples contain a trivial C++ program, but include build instructions for SCons + OS X (10.10) only. That shouldn't affect the class, but if you'd like to, please open a PR to add build files for other OS's and tools.
